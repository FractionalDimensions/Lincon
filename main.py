"""
main.py
-------
This is the main entry point for your application. It ties together:
1. Data preparation and model training (voice_model.py).
2. Bot response logic (bot_responses.py).
3. Discord bot interactions (discord_interactions.py).

Instructions:
1. Make sure you've installed all dependencies (e.g., pip install discord.py torch coqui_tts).
2. Set up your Discord bot token (e.g., as an environment variable DISCORD_TOKEN, or replace below).
3. Decide if you want to train/fine-tune a model or just load a pre-trained model. Adjust the code as needed.
4. Run `python main.py` to start the application.
